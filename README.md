# My_Projects

My passion for programming and financial markets has drove me to enter the innovative and ever growing world of Quantitative Research.

This repository contains several Quantitative Strategies that I have developed over time. 

These are a combination of portfolio optimization, long-short strategies, short-term trading strategies among other really fun stuff!

Do reach out if you have any comments/suggestions.
